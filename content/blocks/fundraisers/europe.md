The project is…

We’ve become Europe's largest grassroots mutual aid supply chain. This has been achieved through:

* Re-building the fragmentation that prevented effective collaboration and long-term planning.
* Strengthening aid groups capacity to run their projects whilst promoting hyper local humanitarian action.
* Multiply collective impact of the border grassroots network across Europe.

Current activities…

* Creating communication streams
* Aid-matching, needs assessment - filtering aid so groups are getting what they need
* Alleviating the logistical burden of delivering humanitarian aid through shipments
* Recentering efforts
* Regular route UK-Northern France

Your money will help us…

* Subsidize costs of in-kind donations to our network of groups
  * Example of what % of the costs grassroots paid for a recent in-kind donation
  * I.e. one truck from UK to France costs $2,000; loading labor fuel, renting mode of transport, fuel…
* Stipends of logistics coordinators
* Cost of phone bill
* Self-taught but find ourselves as experts, would love to join training courses ..etc which cost money (give examples & costs)
* Office costs.
