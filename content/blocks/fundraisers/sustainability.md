  Distribute Aid is focused on supporting sustainability in the humanitarian aid field.

  Our main mode of transportation for the delivery of humanitarian aid to where it’s needed, is road and sea freight.

  * Road freight currently generates 15% of European C02 emissions and 10% of total global emissions.
  * Maritime shipping contributes to an estimated 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

  Support this project to help us move towards green humanitarian supply chains.

The project is…

* Grassroots movement is paramount in supporting vulnerable communities.
* Through inefficiencies, the supply chain can create waste and have a negative impact on local environments.
* Distribute Aid is striving to create accessible / feasible solutions across the network to mitigate climate impact of our footprint.
* Supporting other groups to do it too, even through awareness.

Current activities…

As well as our recently launched [project based offset program](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17q5VbZmS9PauLgoiSvsHG_dz9ku1_xRz/view?usp=sharing).

Your money will help us…

* If the aid groups cannot afford to pay our sustainability fee on shipments, your money will go to cover this offset fee.
  * **_Give example of how much a fee is for a regular route to xx_**
* Through our in-kind donations programme, a recurring problem is cost of shipping and storage space, which is often passed onto grassroots that do not have the financial capacity to raise the funds. Your money can be allocated towards these costs.
  * **_Give an example of an in-kind shipping cost._**
* Aid amalgamation; rent storage space for aid amalgamation to occur i.e. grassroots in different time zones, with different capacities need flexibility. Having storage means they can drop off aid in the best way that supports them (efficient / optimal).
  * Not full trucks; could top them up at these warehouses when necessary
  * Aid prepositioning i.e. France needs 5,000 socks we can put that on a truck coming that way etc.
