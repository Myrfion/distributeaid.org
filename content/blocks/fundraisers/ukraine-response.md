The project is…

* Setting up a long-term relief response
* Kayleigh & Florence
  * Explain roles & responsibilities

Current activities…

* Logistics Cluster to connect groups working in different regions
  * Example of what has come of this
* Scale our supply chain support and help our partners grow their response
  * To date we have sent x amount of aid to Ukraine/neighbouring countries
* Planning a trip to build further connections, understanding of the situation/warehouse space…etc. So we can respond to needs quicker
* Understand current inefficiencies across the supply chain, finding solutions
* NeedsList

Your money will help us…

* _Offer subsidised shipments_
  * _Take an example of a shipment we’ve done, how much it cost i.e. $1,000 broken down by the legs of the journey & how much aid was shipped._
* _For long-term scalability; support our volunteers Kayliegh & Florence, to continue building out this project beyond the initial stage through their stipends_
  * _Taking on more shipments_
  * _Setting up a regular route - how much did it cost to do this for UK to Lebanon._
